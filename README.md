Android Genetic Cars
===========
This is essentially a port of [HTML5 Genetic Cars](https://github.com/red42/HTML5_Genetic_Cars) to Android, via libgdx/box2d.  Many of the algorithms and simulation settings are taken directly from there.  Please check out the original project to find out more.

If you notice anything wrong/buggy please let me know! As it stands now I have tested on an HTC One X and a Nexus 7, it seems to do OK. However, as with the original, (maybe even more so) there are deterministic issues.  Any given car may not peform the same as it did previously.
